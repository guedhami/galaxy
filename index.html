        <h2>ðŸ“œ What Is a Galaxy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.
        </p>

        <p>
          We live on a planet called Earth that is part of our solar system. But where is our solar system? Itâ€™s a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy.
        </p>
        A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions  of stars and their solar systems. A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supermassive black hole in the middle.
        <p>
          When you look up at stars in the night sky, youâ€™re seeing other stars in the Milky Way. If itâ€™s really dark, far away from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.

        <h2>Types of Galaxies</h2>

        <p>
          Spiral galaxies look like giant pinwheels. The arms of the pinwheel are made up of stars and lots of gas and dust. Gas and dust are some of the main ingredients needed to form new stars. Young stars burn much hotter than older stars, so spiral galaxies are often some of the brightest in the universe. About 60% of nearby galaxies are spirals. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is a very good example of one.
        </p>

        <h2>Elliptical galaxies</h2>

        <p>
          Elliptical galaxies are shaped like stretched-out circles, or ellipses. Some elliptical galaxies are more stretched out than others. One might look almost perfectly circular. Another one might look long and flat. Elliptical galaxies contain mostly older stars. That means they often aren't as bright as spiral galaxies. They also have very little dust and gas. Elliptical galaxies are the largest and most common galaxies observed. They make up about 20% of nearby galaxies.

        <p>
          Where is the barycenter between Earth and the sun? Well, the sun has lots of mass. In comparison, Earth's mass is very small. That means the sun is like the head of the sledgehammer. So, the barycenter between Earth and the sun is very close to the center of the sun.

Jupiter is a lot larger than Earth. It has 318 times more mass. As a result, the barycenter of Jupiter and the sun isnâ€™t in the center of the sun. Itâ€™s actually just outside the sun's surface!

        <h2>What Is a Black Hole?</h2>

        <p>
          A black hole is an area of such immense gravity that nothing -- not even light -- can escape from it.
        </p>

        <h2>Black holes</h2>

        <p>
          Black holes can form in many ways though, and large black holes can have tens to millions of times the mass of our sun trapped in a point smaller than the tip of a pin! Some black holes trap more and more material as their mass increases.

The point where all that mass is trapped is called a singularity. It may be infinitely small, but its influence is enormous.
